# Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken? 

### Data folder  
We use 2000 images as data. Divide train/test ratio as 80/20  

labels.csv contain the label for the 2000 images.  

sift_features.csv inside the sift_features folder contain the SIFT feature of the 2000 images.  

Train_nn.csv and Test_nn.csv contain the training set and testing set for Neural Network Classifier  

Train_svm.csv and Test_svm.csv contain the training set and testing set for SVM Classifier  
(The reason for the different data preprocessing is that NN Classifier needs extra scaling while SVM does not.)
