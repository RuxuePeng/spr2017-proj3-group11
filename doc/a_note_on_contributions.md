### A Note on Contributions

Project 3

Team members:+ Ruxue Peng, Raphaël Ruscassie, Yifei Tang, Chengcen Zhou, Hongyi Zhu

Summary: In this project, we explored different methods for feature extraction and classification. We are able to achieve a classification accuracy for images of poodle dogs and fried chicken of 90%. 

[Contribution Statement] 
(1)Data preprocessing: Raphaël, Hongyi, Ruxue  
(2)Feature Selection: Raphaël, Hongyi, Ruxue, Chengcen  
(3)Finding Classifier: Ruxue, Yifei  
  Detail: baseline, gb trees, bagging, random forest, neural network code in both R and python: Ruxue  
  RBF SVM, linear SVM: Yifei  
  Tuning of the above: Yifei and Ruxue  
(4)rPython related: Hongyi  
(5)Github organization, writing readme: Hongyi,Yifei,Ruxue  

Detail:
Ruxue tuned a gradient boosting tree and a random forest in Python. She also wrote iPython notebooks on bagging, neural network, tuning, and a linear support vector machine. Raphaël trimmed the 5000 given features per image down to roughly 400 through LASSO coefficients. Yifei wrote the files for the two classifiers in R: MLP and SVM. Connie helped develop new features with OpenCV but unfortunately it didn't work out and we didn't have time to implement. Hongyi Zhu worked on rPython, which is a piece of garbage, and it didn't work out. Hongyi Zhu also helped organize this github repo and synthesized results from all the team members into the following file: main.rmd, main.r, train.r, test.r, feature_selection.r.

It was a tough ride, but we made it.
