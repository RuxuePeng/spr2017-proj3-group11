### A Note on Contributions

Project 3

Team members:+ Ruxue Peng, Raphaël Ruscassie, Yifei Tang, Chengcen Zhou, Hongyi Zhu

Summary: In this project, we explored different methods for feature extraction, classification, and combined the result through ensemble methods. We are able to achieve a classification accuracy for images of poodle dogs and fried chicken of 90%. 

[Contribution Statement] Ruxue tuned a gradient boosting tree and a random forest in Python. She also wrote iPython notebooks on bagging, neural network, tuning, and a linear support vector machine. Raphaël trimmed the 5000 given features per image down to roughly 400 through LASSO coefficients.



AB and CD developed baseline classification model for evaluation. EF and GH explored feature engineering for improving the baseline model. AB, EF and GH discussed and designed the model evaluation protocol. CD carried out the computation for model evaluation.
