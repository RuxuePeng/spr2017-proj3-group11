### A Note on Contributions

Project 3

Team members:+ Ruxue Peng, Raphaël Ruscassie, Yifei Tang, Chengcen Zhou, Hongyi Zhu

Summary: In this project, we explored different methods for feature extraction, classification, and combined the result through ensemble methods. We are able to achieve a classification accuracy for images of poodle dogs and fried chicken of 90%. 

[Contribution Statement] Ruxue tuned a gradient boosting tree and a random forest in Python. She also wrote iPython notebooks on bagging, neural network, tuning, and a linear support vector machine. Raphaël trimmed the 5000 given features per image down to roughly 400 through LASSO coefficients. Yifei wrote the files for the two classifiers in R: MLP and SVM. Connie helped develop new features but unfortunately we didn't have time to implement. Hongyi Zhu worked on rPython, which is a piece of garbage, and it didn't work out. Hongyi Zhu also helped organize this github repo and synthesized results from all the team members into the following file: main.rmd, main.r, train.r, test.r, feature_selection.r. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
